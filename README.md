# AI/ML Weekend Learning Journey

This repository documents my self-driven 6-month path to becoming an AI/ML expert, following a structured weekend curriculum. The approach is hands-on, heavily focused on research, experimentation, and practical projects rather than passive tutorials.

## Structure

- **Duration:** 6 Months (Weekends; ~3 hours/day)
- **Approach:** Active learning—research topics, implement code, document learnings, complete projects.
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and more.

## Repository Organization

- `week_n`: Folder for each week’s notes, code, and research.
  - `day1/`: Work and notes for Saturday
  - `day2/`: Work and notes for Sunday
- `projects/`: End-of-month and capstone projects
- `resources/`: Datasets, favorite articles, cheatsheets, and references

## About the Curriculum

The plan covers:

- Python & ML fundamentals
- Core algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)
- Deep learning (neural networks, CNNs, RNNs)
- Applied AI: NLP, timeseries, recommender systems
- Software engineering and reproducible research
- Monthly mini-projects; a final capstone project

Detailed curriculum can be found in [`curriculum.md`](curriculum.md) (if present).

## Key Principles

- **Active Research:** Every week involves researching new concepts and coding from scratch or with minimal guidance.
- **Practicals:** Code, experiment, and document findings and failures.
- **Project-based:** Each month ends with a standalone project showcasing acquired skills.
